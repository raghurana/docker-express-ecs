# ECS Fargate Cluster Implementation PRD

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a new ECS Fargate cluster for non-production workloads with minimal cost configuration. The solution will include an ECR registry for container image management, a load balancer frontend, and comprehensive health checking at both the container and load balancer levels.

## Business Requirements

- **Cost Optimization**: Minimal/cheap configuration suitable for non-production environments
- **Container Management**: ECR registry for storing and managing container images
- **Load Balancing**: Application Load Balancer (ALB) with target group routing to ECS tasks
- **Health Monitoring**: Multi-level health checks for reliability and auto-recovery
- **Infrastructure as Code**: CDK-based deployment leveraging existing patterns

## Technical Requirements

### Core Infrastructure Components

1. **VPC & Networking**

   - Private subnets for ECS tasks
   - Public subnets for load balancer
   - NAT Gateway for outbound internet access
   - Security groups with minimal required permissions

2. **ECS Fargate Cluster**

   - Serverless compute using Fargate
   - Auto-scaling based on CPU/memory utilization
   - Task definition with health check configuration
   - Service discovery and load balancing integration

3. **ECR Registry**

   - Private repository for container images
   - Lifecycle policies for cost management
   - Cross-account access if needed

4. **Load Balancer**

   - Application Load Balancer (ALB)
   - Target group with health check configuration
   - SSL termination support
   - Access logging

5. **Health Checks**
   - Container-level health checks (ECS task health)
   - Load balancer target group health checks
   - CloudWatch alarms for monitoring

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Cost**: Target monthly cost < $50 for non-prod workloads
- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime SLA
- **Scalability**: Auto-scaling from 1 to 4 tasks based on demand
- **Security**: Least privilege access, encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics and alarms for key health indicators

## Architecture Design

### High-Level Architecture

```
Internet → ALB → Target Group → ECS Fargate Tasks (Private Subnets)
                ↓
            ECR Registry

   - Target group with health check path
   - Security group allowing HTTP/HTTPS traffic
   - Health check configuration matching application endpoints

4. **ECR Stack**
   - Private repository with lifecycle policies
   - Cross-account permissions if needed
   - Image scanning and vulnerability detection

## Technical Specifications

### ECS Task Configuration

```typescript
// Minimal Fargate configuration for cost optimization
const taskDefinition = new ecs.FargateTaskDefinition(this, "TaskDef", {
  memoryLimitMiB: 512, // 0.5 GB RAM
  cpu: 256, // 0.25 vCPU
  runtimePlatform: {
    operatingSystemFamily: ecs.OperatingSystemFamily.LINUX,
    cpuArchitecture: ecs.CpuArchitecture.X86_64,
  },
});
```

### Load Balancer Health Check

```typescript
// Health check configuration
const targetGroup = new elbv2.ApplicationTargetGroup(this, "TargetGroup", {
  port: 3000,
  protocol: elbv2.ApplicationProtocol.HTTP,
  targetType: elbv2.TargetType.IP,
  healthCheck: {
    path: "/health",
    healthyHttpCodes: "200",
    interval: Duration.seconds(30),
    timeout: Duration.seconds(5),
    healthyThresholdCount: 2,
    unhealthyThresholdCount: 3,
  },
});
```

### Auto-scaling Configuration

```typescript
// Cost-optimized auto-scaling
const scaling = service.autoScaleTaskCount({
  minCapacity: 1,
  maxCapacity: 4,
});

scaling.scaleOnCpuUtilization("CpuScaling", {
  targetUtilizationPercent: 70,
  scaleInCooldown: Duration.seconds(60),
  scaleOutCooldown: Duration.seconds(60),
});
```

## Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Resource Allocation**

   - Start with minimal CPU (0.25 vCPU) and memory (0.5 GB)
   - Use Spot instances for non-critical workloads
   - Implement auto-scaling with conservative thresholds

2. **ECR Cost Management**

   - Lifecycle policies to delete old images
   - Cross-account sharing to avoid duplication
   - Image compression and optimization

3. **Network Optimization**
   - Single NAT Gateway (not per AZ)
   - Minimal data transfer between AZs
   - Efficient security group rules

## Security Considerations

1. **Network Security**

   - Private subnets for ECS tasks
   - Security groups with minimal required access
   - VPC endpoints for AWS services

2. **Container Security**

   - ECR image scanning enabled
   - Non-root user in containers
   - Secrets management via AWS Secrets Manager

3. **Access Control**
   - IAM roles with least privilege
   - Resource-based policies
   - CloudTrail logging for audit

## Monitoring & Observability

1. **CloudWatch Metrics**

   - ECS service metrics (CPU, memory, task count)
   - ALB metrics (request count, latency, error rate)
   - Custom application metrics

2. **Alarms & Notifications**

   - High CPU/memory utilization
   - Unhealthy target count
   - Service error rate thresholds

3. **Logging**
   - Application logs via CloudWatch Logs
   - ALB access logs
   - ECS task logs

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk

- **Cost Overrun**: Mitigation through strict resource limits and monitoring
- **Service Availability**: Mitigation through health checks and auto-scaling

### Medium Risk

- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Mitigation through regular updates and scanning
- **Performance Issues**: Mitigation through load testing and optimization

### Low Risk

- **Deployment Complexity**: Mitigation through CDK patterns and documentation
