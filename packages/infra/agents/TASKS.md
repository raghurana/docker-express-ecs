# Project Implementation Tasks

## ECS Fargate Cluster Implementation

Implementation of a new ECS Fargate cluster for non-production environments with minimal cost configuration, including ECR registry, load balancer, and health checks.

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Configure environment variables
- [x] Create Express TypeScript server with health check endpoint
- [x] Create Dockerfile for containerization
- [x] Create comprehensive PRD for ECS Fargate cluster

### In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Design CDK stack architecture for ECS Fargate cluster
- [x] Configure CDK for ap-southeast-2 region deployment

### Future Tasks

- [ ] Implement ECR repository with lifecycle policies
- [ ] Create ECS Fargate cluster construct
- [ ] Configure Application Load Balancer
- [ ] Set up target group and listener rules
- [ ] Implement ECS service with health checks
- [ ] Configure IAM roles and security groups
- [ ] Test ECR push/pull operations
- [ ] Validate ECS service deployment
- [ ] Test load balancer health checks
- [ ] Verify end-to-end connectivity
- [ ] Implement cost monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

## Implementation Plan

The ECS Fargate cluster will be implemented in phases:

1. **Infrastructure Setup**: ECR, ECS cluster, ALB, security groups
2. **Service Configuration**: Task definition, service, target group
3. **Testing & Validation**: Health checks, connectivity, performance

### Relevant Files

- `ECS_FARGATE_CLUSTER_PRD.md` - Comprehensive product requirements document ✅
- `../lib/infra-stack.ts` - Main infrastructure stack (to be enhanced)
- `../../server/src/index.ts` - Express server with health check endpoint ✅
- `../../server/Dockerfile` - Container image definition ✅
- `../package.json` - CDK dependencies and scripts ✅

### Architecture Overview

```
Internet → ALB → Target Group → ECS Fargate Service → Container
                ↓
            ECR Registry ← Container Image Push
```

### Cost Estimation

- **Total Estimated Monthly Cost**: ~$27-35/month
- **ECS Fargate**: ~$8-12/month (0.25 vCPU, 0.5GB RAM)
- **ALB**: ~$18/month (fixed cost)
- **ECR**: ~$0.10/month (storage + data transfer)
- **Data Transfer**: ~$1-5/month

### Success Criteria

- [ ] ECS Fargate cluster successfully deployed
- [ ] ECR repository accessible and functional
- [ ] Load balancer health checks passing
- [ ] Container health checks working
- [ ] End-to-end connectivity verified
- [ ] Cost within budget (<$50/month)
- [ ] Health check endpoint responding correctly
