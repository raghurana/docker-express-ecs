# Project Implementation Tasks

## ECS Fargate Cluster Implementation

Implementation of a new ECS Fargate cluster for non-production environments with minimal cost configuration, including ECR registry, load balancer, and health checks.

### Completed Tasks

- [x] Set up project structure
- [x] Configure environment variables
- [x] Create Express TypeScript server with health check endpoint
- [x] Create Dockerfile for containerization
- [x] Create comprehensive PRD for ECS Fargate cluster
- [x] Design CDK stack architecture for ECS Fargate cluster
- [x] Configure CDK for ap-southeast-2 region deployment
- [x] Implement ECR repository with lifecycle policies
- [x] Create ECS Fargate cluster construct
- [x] Configure Application Load Balancer
- [x] Set up target group and listener rules
- [x] Implement ECS service with health checks
- [x] Configure IAM roles and security groups
- [x] Create VPC with single AZ for cost optimization
- [x] Synthesize CloudFormation template successfully

### In Progress Tasks

- [ ] Deploy infrastructure to AWS
- [ ] Build and push container image to ECR

### Future Tasks

- [ ] Test ECR push/pull operations
- [ ] Validate ECS service deployment
- [ ] Test load balancer health checks
- [ ] Verify end-to-end connectivity
- [ ] Implement cost monitoring and optimization
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

## Implementation Plan

The ECS Fargate cluster has been successfully implemented in CDK with the following components:

### Infrastructure Components ✅

1. **VPC Setup**: Single AZ VPC with public subnet (cost optimized)
2. **ECR Repository**: `docker-express-env` with lifecycle policies
3. **ECS Cluster**: `docker-express-cluster` with Fargate capacity
4. **Application Load Balancer**: Internet-facing ALB with health checks
5. **Target Group**: HTTP target group with `/health` endpoint monitoring
6. **ECS Service**: Fargate service with 1 desired count (minimal cost)
7. **Security Groups**: Proper ingress/egress rules for ALB and ECS
8. **IAM Roles**: Task execution and task roles with ECR permissions
9. **CloudWatch Logs**: Log group for ECS task logging

### Architecture Overview

```
Internet → ALB → Target Group → ECS Fargate Service → Container
                ↓
            ECR Registry ← Container Image Push
```

### Cost Optimization Features ✅

- **Single AZ deployment**: Reduces data transfer costs
- **No NAT Gateway**: Uses public subnets only
- **Minimal resources**: 0.25 vCPU, 0.5GB RAM
- **Short log retention**: 1 week CloudWatch logs
- **ECR lifecycle policies**: Auto-cleanup of old images
- **Container insights disabled**: Reduces monitoring costs

### Deployment Ready

The infrastructure is ready for deployment with the following outputs:
- ECR Repository URI
- Load Balancer DNS and URL
- Health Check URL
- Cluster and Service names
- VPC ID

### Next Steps

1. **Deploy Infrastructure**: Run `cdk deploy` to create AWS resources
2. **Build Container**: Build Docker image from Express server
3. **Push to ECR**: Push container image to ECR repository
4. **Verify Deployment**: Test health checks and connectivity

### Relevant Files

- `ECS_FARGATE_CLUSTER_PRD.md` - Comprehensive product requirements document ✅
- `../lib/infra-stack.ts` - Complete infrastructure stack implementation ✅
- `../../server/src/index.ts` - Express server with health check endpoint ✅
- `../../server/Dockerfile` - Container image definition ✅
- `../package.json` - CDK dependencies and scripts ✅

### Success Criteria Progress

- [x] ECS Fargate cluster successfully designed
- [x] ECR repository configured and ready
- [x] Load balancer health checks configured
- [x] Container health checks implemented
- [ ] End-to-end connectivity verified (pending deployment)
- [x] Cost within budget (<$50/month estimated at ~$27-35/month)
- [x] Health check endpoint responding correctly (in code)
