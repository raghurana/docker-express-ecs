  - [ ] Set up environment variables and secrets
  - [ ] Configure logging and monitoring
- [ ] Configure ECS service with auto-scaling
  - [ ] Create ECS service with task definition
  - [ ] Set up auto-scaling policies (1-4 tasks)
  - [ ] Configure CPU-based scaling thresholds
  - [ ] Set up service discovery if needed

### Phase 3: Load Balancer (Week 3)

- [ ] Deploy Application Load Balancer
  - [ ] Create ALB in public subnets
  - [ ] Configure security groups for HTTP/HTTPS traffic
  - [ ] Set up SSL certificates and HTTPS listeners
  - [ ] Configure access logging
- [ ] Configure target group and health checks
  - [ ] Create target group pointing to ECS service
  - [ ] Configure health check path and parameters
  - [ ] Set up health check thresholds and intervals
  - [ ] Test health check connectivity
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates and listeners
  - [ ] Configure HTTPS listener on port 443
  - [ ] Set up HTTP to HTTPS redirect
  - [ ] Configure SSL certificate management

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Week 4)

- [ ] Deploy sample application container
  - [ ] Build and push sample container to ECR
  - [ ] Deploy container to ECS service
  - [ ] Verify container startup and health checks
- [ ] Test health checks and auto-scaling
  - [ ] Test container-level health checks
  - [ ] Test load balancer health checks
  - [ ] Test auto-scaling under load
  - [ ] Verify failover and recovery
- [ ] Configure monitoring and alerting
  - [ ] Set up CloudWatch metrics and dashboards
  - [ ] Configure alarms for key health indicators
  - [ ] Set up notifications for critical events
- [ ] Performance testing and cost optimization
  - [ ] Load test the application
  - [ ] Monitor resource utilization
  - [ ] Optimize resource allocation
  - [ ] Verify cost targets are met

## Implementation Plan

The implementation follows a phased approach to ensure proper testing and validation at each stage. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for incremental deployment and testing.

### Architecture Components

- **VPC Stack**: Networking foundation with public/private subnets
- **ECS Stack**: Fargate cluster with auto-scaling and health checks
- **Load Balancer Stack**: ALB with target group and health monitoring
- **ECR Stack**: Container registry with lifecycle management

### Cost Optimization Strategy

- Start with minimal resource allocation (0.25 vCPU, 0.5 GB RAM)
- Implement conservative auto-scaling (1-4 tasks)
- Use single NAT Gateway instead of per-AZ
- Configure ECR lifecycle policies to manage storage costs

- `packages/infra/bin/infra.ts` - CDK app entry point (to be modified)
- `packages/server/` - Sample application for testing (existing)

## Technical Notes

- Leverage existing CDK patterns from the project
- Use TypeScript for all infrastructure code
- Implement proper error handling and rollback strategies
- Follow AWS Well-Architected Framework principles
- Ensure security best practices (least privilege, encryption, monitoring)

## Dependencies

- AWS CDK v2.211.0 (already configured)
- TypeScript 5.3.0 (already configured)
- AWS CLI and credentials configured
- Container images ready for deployment
- SSL certificates for HTTPS support
